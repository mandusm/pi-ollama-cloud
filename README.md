# pi-ollama-cloud

Ollama Cloud provider plugin for [Pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) coding agent.

Registers Ollama Cloud as a model provider with dynamically fetched models, and provides `ollama_web_search` and `ollama_web_fetch` tools that use the [Ollama Cloud web search API](https://docs.ollama.com/capabilities/web-search) - no local Ollama server required.

## Features

- **Dynamic model discovery** - Fetches the full model list from `ollama.com/v1/models`, then fetches per-model details via `/api/show` to determine capabilities, context length, and tool support.
- **Curated thinking levels** - Maps Pi's thinking levels to Ollama Cloud's OpenAI-compatible `reasoning_effort` values via `thinking-levels.ts`, with per-model exceptions based on API testing.
- **Persistent cache** - Raw API responses are cached at `~/.pi/agent/cache/ollama-cloud-models.json` so models are available immediately on startup without hitting the network.
- **Startup refresh** - When the local cache is stale, the plugin uses it immediately and then runs the same visible refresh flow as `/ollama-cloud-refresh` once the Pi session UI is available. Missing/invalid caches use a small fallback list until refresh completes.
- **`/ollama-cloud-refresh` command** - Re-fetches the model list and updates the cache and provider registration live (no restart needed).
- **`ollama_web_search` tool** - Search the web for real-time information using Ollama Cloud's `/api/web_search` endpoint. Returns titles, URLs, and content snippets.
- **`ollama_web_fetch` tool** - Fetch and extract text content from a web page URL using Ollama Cloud's `/api/web_fetch` endpoint. Returns page title, content, and links.
- **Zero cost tracking** - All models are registered with zero costs since Ollama Cloud uses a flat subscription model (Free, Pro, Max) rather than per-token billing. Per-request costs don't apply, so Pi's cost tracker always shows zero. See [ollama.com/pricing](https://ollama.com/pricing) for plan details.

## Prerequisites

- An [Ollama Cloud API key](https://ollama.com)

## Installation

### Option 1: from npm (recommended)

```bash
pi install npm:pi-ollama-cloud
```

This installs the latest published version from npm. Run `pi update` to get new versions.

### Option 2: from git

```bash
pi install git:github.com/fgrehm/pi-ollama-cloud
```

This clones the repo to `~/.pi/agent/git/` and adds it to your settings.

For project-local install (stored in `.pi/git/`):

```bash
pi install git:github.com/fgrehm/pi-ollama-cloud --local
```

### Option 3: `-e` flag (try without installing)

```bash
pi -e npm:pi-ollama-cloud
```

### Option 4: Clone manually (if you want to make changes and "try it live")

Pi auto-discovers subdirectories under `~/.pi/agent/extensions/`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:fgrehm/pi-ollama-cloud.git ~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-ollama-cloud
```

## Setup

### 1. Get an API key

Sign up at [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) and generate an API key.

### 2. Configure the API key

Either set the `OLLAMA_API_KEY` environment variable:

```bash
export OLLAMA_API_KEY="your-key"
```

Or add it to `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`:

```json
{
  "ollama-cloud": {
    "type": "api_key",
    "key": "your-key"
  }
}
```

### 3. Configure the extension (optional)

Extension settings can be set via JSON config files. Project-local settings override global/user-level settings.

| Location | Scope |
|---|---|
| `~/.pi/agent/ollama-cloud.json` | Global / user-level (all projects) |
| `.pi/ollama-cloud.json` | Project-local (takes precedence) |

**Available settings:**

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `webTools` | boolean | `true` | Set to `false` to prevent `ollama_web_search` and `ollama_web_fetch` from being registered |

Example `ollama-cloud.json`:

```json
{
  "webTools": false
}
```

The `PI_OLLAMA_WEB_TOOLS` environment variable still works as an override above config files. Set it to `0`, `false`, `no`, or `off` to disable web tools regardless of config file settings.

### 4. Fetch models

On first launch the plugin registers a small hardcoded fallback list, then refreshes model metadata automatically with the same progress widget used by the manual command. If an existing cache is merely stale, that cached model list remains active while refresh runs. You can also run:

```
/ollama-cloud-refresh
```

This fetches the full model list from the Ollama Cloud API and overwrites the local cache.

### 5. Select a model

Use `/model` or `Ctrl+L` to switch to an Ollama Cloud model. Models appear under the `ollama-cloud` provider.

## How it works

The plugin uses two Ollama Cloud API endpoints to build the model list:

1. **`GET https://ollama.com/v1/models`** - Returns a list of all available model IDs.
2. **`POST https://ollama.com/api/show`** - For each model, fetches details including capabilities (`tools`, `thinking`, `vision`) and context length.

Only models with the `tools` capability are registered - these are the ones Pi can use for tool-calling.

The raw `/api/show` responses are cached at `~/.pi/agent/cache/ollama-cloud-models.json` with a top-level `timestamp` value. If that local cache is older than 30 days, the plugin keeps using it immediately and triggers the visible refresh flow on `session_start`. If the cache is missing or invalid, the plugin registers a small hardcoded model list until refresh succeeds. If no key is available or refresh fails, the current registered list remains active until `/ollama-cloud-refresh` succeeds.

Model metadata is derived from the cached data:

| Field | Source |
|---|---|
| `reasoning` | `capabilities` includes `"thinking"` |
| `thinkingLevelMap` | [`thinking-levels.ts`](thinking-levels.ts) with 4 maps (DEFAULT, GPT_OSS, QWEN3, NO_OFF) based on API testing |
| `input` | `["text", "image"]` if `capabilities` includes `"vision"`, else `["text"]` |
| `contextWindow` | `model_info.*.context_length` (falls back to 128000) |
| `maxTokens` | Fixed at 32768 |
| `cost` | All zeros (Ollama Cloud uses subscription plans, not per-token billing - see [pricing](https://ollama.com/pricing)) |

### Thinking level mapping

Pi's thinking levels are mapped to Ollama Cloud's OpenAI-compatible `reasoning_effort` parameter in [`thinking-levels.ts`](thinking-levels.ts). The API accepts `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `max`. Effects of `max` over `high` vary by model and prompt difficulty - see [`docs/think-experiment.md`](docs/think-experiment.md) for details.

| Map | Models | Levels exposed | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DEFAULT` | Most thinking models | off, low, medium, high, xhigh | `minimal` hidden (duplicate of low) |
| `GPT_OSS` | `gpt-oss*` | low, medium, high | Can't disable thinking, no off or xhigh |
| `QWEN3` | `qwen3*` (except `qwen3-vl*`) | off, medium | Binary-only (think/nothink), no gradation |
| `NO_OFF` | `qwen3-vl*`, `kimi-k2-thinking`, `minimax*` | low, medium, high, xhigh | "none" doesn't disable thinking on these models |

See [docs/think-experiment.md](docs/think-experiment.md) for the testing methodology and results.

Refresh from inside Pi:

```text
/ollama-cloud-refresh
```

That command updates `~/.pi/agent/cache/ollama-cloud-models.json` with a new `timestamp` and re-registers the provider live, so no restart is required.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `ollama_web_search` | Search the web via Ollama Cloud's `/api/web_search` |
| `ollama_web_fetch` | Fetch a web page via Ollama Cloud's `/api/web_fetch` |

Both tools use the same Ollama Cloud API key configured for the provider. No local Ollama server is needed.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/ollama-cloud-refresh` | Fetch models from the Ollama Cloud API, update cache, and re-register the provider |

## Development

```bash
npm install          # install devDependencies (biome)
npm run check        # lint + format with auto-fix
npm run lint        # lint only (no fixes)
npm run format      # format only
```

The project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting (2-space indent, line width 120).

## How is this different from `ollama launch pi`?

[`ollama launch pi`](https://docs.ollama.com/integrations/pi) is Ollama's built-in one-command setup that configures Pi to talk to your **local Ollama server**. Both local and cloud models work - cloud models (e.g. `qwen3.5:cloud`) are proxied through your local server to `ollama.com`. This extension takes a different approach: it connects Pi **directly** to Ollama's hosted API at `ollama.com`, bypassing the local server entirely.

| | `ollama launch pi` | `pi-ollama-cloud` |
|---|---|---|
| **Provider name** | `ollama` | `ollama-cloud` |
| **Endpoint** | Local Ollama server (`http://localhost:11434/v1`) | Ollama Cloud (`https://ollama.com/v1`) |
| **Local models** | ✅ Run on your machine | ❌ Not available |
| **Cloud models** | ✅ Proxied through local server (e.g. `qwen3.5:cloud`) | ✅ Connected directly |
| **Local Ollama required?** | Yes - must be installed and running | No - works without any local server |
| **Authentication** | Handled by the local server (sign-in flow via `ollama`) | Ollama Cloud API key (set via `OLLAMA_API_KEY` or `auth.json`) |
| **Model discovery** | Interactive picker with curated recommendations + pulled models | Dynamic - fetches all available cloud models with tool support from the API |
| **Web tools** | Auto-installed (`@ollama/pi-web-search`) when cloud is enabled | ✅ Built-in: `ollama_web_search` and `ollama_web_fetch` use the [Ollama Cloud web search API](https://docs.ollama.com/capabilities/web-search) directly (same API key, no local server needed) |
| **Setup effort** | One command: `ollama launch pi` | Install extension + API key + `/ollama-cloud-refresh` |
| **Use when** | You're already running Ollama locally and want the default experience | You don't want to run a local server, or want a standalone cloud-only provider alongside your local setup |

**You can use both at the same time.** The providers live under different names (`ollama` vs `ollama-cloud`), so you can switch between them with `/model` or `Ctrl+L`. For example, use your local `ollama` provider for low-latency work on smaller models, and `ollama-cloud` for direct access to the full catalog of cloud models without needing a local server.

> **Note:** The [`@ollama/pi-web-search`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ollama/pi-web-search) package (installed automatically by `ollama launch pi`) calls the **local** Ollama server's `/api/experimental/web_search` and `/api/experimental/web_fetch` endpoints and authenticates via `ollama signin`. This extension's `ollama_web_search` and `ollama_web_fetch` tools use the **cloud** API at `ollama.com/api/web_search` and `ollama.com/api/web_fetch` instead - same API key, no local server required. Both can coexist: the local tools register as `web_search`/`web_fetch` and these register as `ollama_web_search`/`ollama_web_fetch` to avoid name conflicts.

## Releasing

Publishing a new version to npm is a two-command process:

```bash
# 1. Bump version and create a git tag in one step
npm version minor   # or patch, or major
# 2. Push the tag to trigger the GitHub Actions publish workflow
git push --tags
```

The tag version must match the version in `package.json` - `npm version` handles this automatically. The workflow at `.github/workflows/publish.yml` verifies the match before publishing to npm.

The workflow uses npm's [trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers/) (OIDC) - no tokens stored as secrets. To set it up:

1. Go to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) → your avatar → **Packages** → `pi-ollama-cloud` → **Settings** → **Trusted publishing**
2. Click **GitHub Actions** and enter:
   - **Workflow filename**: `publish.yml`
3. Save

Each publish also gets automatic [provenance attestation](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements).

## Notes

- The extension sets `supportsDeveloperRole: false` on all models so the system prompt always uses `role: "system"`. Without this, pi sends the prompt as `role: "developer"` for thinking-capable models, which some models (e.g. GLM-5.1) ignore entirely - the prompt simply isn't read.
- The fetch timeout is 10 seconds per request. On slow connections, some model detail fetches may time out - the plugin reports how many succeeded vs failed.
